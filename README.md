# Sorting algorithms C++ implementation

## Selection sort
Efficiency: always O(n2).  
No practical usage.
## Insertion sort
Efficiency: average and worst case O(n2).  
It's good for almost sorted and short sequences (less than 50 elements).
## Bubble sort
Efficiency: average and worst case O(n2).  
No practical usage.
